## Data
The dataset utilized in this project is publicly accessible and provides comprehensive information on road accidents in France. The data is organized into four categories, each provided as a separate CSV file:
- CARACTERISTIQUES: Describes the general circumstances of the accident.
- LIEUX: Describes the main location of the accident, even if it occurred at an intersection.
- VEHICULES: Details the vehicles involved in the accident.
- USAGERS: Describes the users involved in the accident.
  
Our primary data source is the national file of road traffic accidents, known as the "Fichier BAAC," managed by the Observatoire National Interministériel de la Sécurité Routière (ONISR). These datasets are available on data.gouv.fr.

The BAAC file contains comprehensive data on all road accidents resulting in bodily injury that occurred in mainland France, as well as in the French overseas departments and territories, during a specific year. The data includes:

- Location information: Describing where the accident occurred.
- Accident characteristics: Details about the nature and circumstances of the accident.
- Vehicle and user information: Specific details about the vehicles and people involved in the accident.

These datasets are available in open data formats. For our analysis, we used the annual datasets from 2019 to 2022, which consist of four CSV files: Caractéristiques, Lieux, Véhicules, and Usagers. 
Extensive data cleaning and preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and relevance of the data for subsequent analysis and modeling.
## Tools and Libraries 
This project was developed using the following tools and libraries:
 - Python: The core programming language used for data analysis, processing, and machine learning.
### Data Visualization
 - Matplotlib: For creating static, high-quality plots and charts.
 - Seaborn: Built on top of Matplotlib, used for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
 - Plotly: Used for creating interactive and dynamic visualization.
### Machine Learning
 - Scikit-learn: Employed for implementing machine learning algorithms and building predictive models.
### Application Development
 - Streamlit: Utilized to create an interactive web app for displaying the results and insights from the analysis.
### Development Environment
 - Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook: Used for writing and excuting Python code in an interactive manner which facilitated collaboration and sharing within the team.
